- 👋 Hi, I’m @DavidRaigozaJ
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3 development, because I think it can make a great difference in the world we live in, by giving us the opportunity to interact with each other in different ways, and I think that web3 will revolutionize the e-commerce.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidity, chainlink, the graph, nextjs and much more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects
- 📫 How to reach me write me on any channel
