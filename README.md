- <p>👀 My journey started through arts when I realized the importance of descentralization, today I understand the importance of opensource, I’m interested in Web3 development, because I think it can make a great difference in the world we live in, by giving us the opportunity to interact with each other in different ways, and I think that web3 will revolutionize finance, e-commerce and create new disruptive dapps.<p>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidity, chainlink, the graph, nextjs, participated in my first chainlink hackathon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects
