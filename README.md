- <p>👀 My journey started through arts when I realized the importance of descentralization, today I understand the importance of opensource, I’m interested in Web3 development, because I think it can make a great difference in the world we live in, by giving us the opportunity to interact with each other in different ways, and I think that web3 will revolutionize finance, e-commerce and create new disruptive dapps.<p>
- 🌱 I’m currently learning solidity, chainlink, the graph, nextjs, participated in my first chainlink hackathon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects. I believe that blockchain technology offers an incredible opportunity to revolutionize the way we interact with money and art. As a design engineering graduate and a master of arts, I bring a fresh perspective to the world of blockchain development. My passion for creating beautiful and meaningful products inspires me to push the boundaries of what's possible with blockchain technology. Whether you need help with building Ethereum nodes or creating innovative NFTs, I have the skills and experience to help you succeed.
